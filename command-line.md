Question 1 - I would describe command code to someone like my mother as a place where you can type demands, and whatever you want to see or move or create will appear. I would describe it like a magical text box where you can do anything you want.
Question 2 - Ten terminal commands:
1- touch (item_name.md): to create a file
2 - git add: add an item to the list to stage the changes
3 - git status: how to check the status of your files
4 - pwd: print working directory, shows where you are
5 - cd ~ : takes you back to your home folder
6 - pushd: saves your place in a directory
7 - popd: takes you back to your saved place, pushd
8 - cd (directory_name): takes you to a specific area in your directory
9 - rmdir: remove a directory
10 - mkdir: create a directory

PS - I hope this is what was required of me. If this is incorrect, let me know and I shall do my best to correct it! Have been trying different types of terminals (PowerShell, babun, Git) but didn't find any instructions on how to use VSC. If this is incorrect, let me know where I can find one. Thank you!
